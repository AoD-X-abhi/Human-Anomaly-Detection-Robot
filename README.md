# Human-Anomaly-Detection-Robot
## Overview  

Public spaces require advanced security solutions to proactively detect potential threats. Traditional surveillance systems are often static and may not respond effectively to dynamic threats.  

Our project introduces a **four-wheeled autonomous robot** designed for **real-time threat detection**. The system integrates **ROS**, **ORB-SLAM**, and **YOLO v3** for localization, object detection, and autonomous navigation.  

By continuously monitoring its environment, the robot:  
- Identifies potential threats  
- Tracks their position  
- Alerts security personnel in real time  

The goal is to **enhance situational awareness** and **improve response time** in high-risk environments.
